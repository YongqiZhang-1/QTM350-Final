# QTM350-Final

If you are an Amazon Alexa user, maybe you have noticed that Alexa can sometimes understand users' questions more precisely than other times. In this project, we want to answer two questions about voice transcribe in ML service Amazon Transcribe. One, "How do different speakers (native and non-native speakers) influence the performance of Amazon Transcribe?" Two, we try to analyze the reasons behind the results.

If you interested in learning the motivation, experimental design, dataset description, data extraction and analysis process, or other more details about our project, you can check out our project blog: ***https://final-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/QTM350FinalProjectBlog-FinalVersion.html***.

The recording of the proposal and all the data (source file, transcribed file, accuracy analysis result etc.) that involved in the project have been uploaded in this repository. 

If you have any question about the project, please feel free to reach out to us.
